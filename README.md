# Makefile Template
This is currently the Makefile I use for my C projects. Having it hosted somewhere saves me the hassle of having to copy or write it from scratch. Cloning makes the process much easier and smoother.

Yes, I know the Makefile isn't pretty. But it helps me catch memory related bugs and leaks, among other useful things for me. Feel free to use it and suggest changes. Might not work on the first commit because it's 2AM, I'm tired and I'm writing this with my eyes half closed.
